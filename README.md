## What is Jenkins?
---
Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server which can be used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and delivering or deploying software.

Jenkins can be installed through native system packages, Docker, or even run standalone by any machine with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.
## What are the Benefits and How can we use it?

Jenkins can be easily set up and configured via its web interface, which includes on-the-fly error checks and built-in help.

- **Plugins**
With hundreds of plugins in the Update Center, Jenkins integrates with pratically every tool in the continuous integration and continuous delivery toolchain.

- **Extensible**
Jenkins can be extended via its plugin architecture, providing nearly infinite possibilities for what Jenkins can do.
